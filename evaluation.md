## Startup Project with High Added Value (topic of your choice)

The project must:

- Be hosted on a **public open-source Git repository**
- Include **Pull Requests** with **review/validation** between team members
- Contain **Unit Tests**, ideally following a **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) approach
- Include a **public Kanban board**
- Contain a **preprocessing phase**, such as:
  - In the MLOps lab, the preprocessing step is the **extraction of images from a PDF**
  - It can also be another turnkey AI component (e.g., text detection, OCR, etc.)
- Include a **mandatory AI training phase**:
  - The AI can be trained **from scratch** (requires a large dataset)
  - Or **fine-tuned** from an existing model (e.g., from **Hugging Face**)
- Use **more than 100 data samples** (images, audio, videos, etc.) **created by you** (not downloaded from the internet) and **annotated manually**
- Be **exposed as a real-time API**
- Optionally include a **web front-end** (not mandatory)

## Presentation Guidelines

1. **Purpose:** What is your project’s functional value? What problem does it solve for end users? What makes it innovative?  
2. **Demo**  
3. **Why are you the best?**  
   - You may include technical details about **MLOps**, **cost**, and **Time to Market**.  
4. **What is missing** — both technically and functionally.
